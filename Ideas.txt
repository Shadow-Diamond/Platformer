SPACE THEME

Planet 1: Virellia
Sky color: Violet
Ground: Glassy black rock that fractures into hexagonal patterns
Gravity: .6 times Earth (600*.6+600 = 960)
Climate/Vegitation: Sparse patches of groves and plants, but otherwise desert-like.
Background Stuff: Crystalline spires in the background

Enemies: Wanted
	Shardback Crawler:
		A stationary enemy that is crab-like. Fused to its shell are translucent crystals that
		glow blue. These crystals are jagged, and hurt the player when touched.
		
	Future Scarab:
		A moving enemy that is about the size of a backpack (probably gonna be bigger).
		It has a reflective black carapace and is covered in thin glowing lines that pulse as
		it moves. This enemy is quick, but never intentionally chases the player. It moves in
		a straight line until it hits something or reaches the edge of a platform, waits a
		second, then turns around and continues walking.

Enemies: Recieved
	Shardback Crawler:
		An enemy that has two modes, Stationary and Moving. It is a turtle-like creature with
		a purple outer-shell. Blue crystals protrude from the creature's back, making it
		impossible to kill by landing ontop of it.
